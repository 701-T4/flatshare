# Guide

Welcome to the frontend codebase!

In order to effectively contribute to the frontend, you should read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/701-T4/platform/wiki/React-Code-Conventions) on our wiki.

To start developing with the frontend, you should run the `npm run start:dev` script at the project root. Make sure you install dependencies (i.e. `yarn`) at the project root first.

For prebuilt UI components, you can use the NextUI package. More custom components can be build using TailwindCSS combined with the classnames package.
