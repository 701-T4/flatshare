# Setup

This project uses a Lerna Monorepo. Lerna is a tool used to manage multiple
JavaScript packages. There are two self-descriptive packages, the backend
package and the frontend package.

## Prerequisites

### Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase for authentication. You may want to set up your own
Firebase project for development of this application. Alternatively, you can
share one with other people.

#### New Project

> Follow this if you want to setup a new Firebase project.

##### Frontend (New Project)

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create
   a new project.

2. Go to the top left cog > Project Settings > Scroll down to the "Your apps"
   section and add a new web app.

3. Copy the firebaseConfig code. It should be a single JS object.

4. Paste that object in a new file named `scripts/firebase-config/data.js`,
   replacing the name of the object with `module.exports` and run the script
   next to that file i.e. `node ./packages/frontend/scripts/firebase-config/FirebaseConfigToClipboard.js`.

5. The script will save information to your clipboard. Paste that into the
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG environment variable, replacing all existing
   contents. Please note the .env.development is a COMMITTED file. If you are
   using a different environment, please create and use a new environment file,
   `.env.development.local`.

##### Backend (New Project)

1. Go to service accounts and generate a new private key

2. Name the downloaded file `firebase.json` and place it in the /keys directory.
   DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE.

#### Sharing or Existing Project

> Follow this if someone else has setup a Firebase project, and you wish to use
> the same one.

##### Frontend (Existing Project)

1. If you can access the console: In Firebase console, go to the top left cog >
   Project Settings > Scroll down to the "Your apps" section. Copy the
   firebaseConfig code. It should be a single JS object.

2. If you cannot access the console: Ask the project owner for the
   firebaseConfig object.

3. Paste that object in a new file named `scripts/firebase-config/data.js`,
   replacing the name of the object with `module.exports` and run the script
   next to that file i.e. `node ./packages/frontend/scripts/firebase-config/FirebaseConfigToClipboard.js`.

4. The script will save information to your clipboard. Paste that into the
   `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG` environment variable, replacing all existing
   contents. Please note the `.env.development` is a **COMMITTED** file. If you are
   using a different environment, please create and use a new environment file,
   `.env.development.local`.

##### Backend (Existing Project)

1. Ask the project owner for a private key.

2. Rename this file `firebase.json` and place it in the /keys directory. **`DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE`**.

### MongoDB

1. Download and install MongoDB: [MongoDB Community
   Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

2. Ensure that MongoDB is running, either as a process or a background service.

## Starting

1. Download yarn. This can be installed via npm `npm install --global yarn`.

2. At the root level of the project, run `yarn`. This will install the packages
   required for Lerna to work, as well as automatically install packages for the
   frontend and backend packages.

3. Once again at the project root, run `npm run start:dev`. This will simultaneously run the frontend and backend.

## Workflow

This project uses [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). Please follow the [checklist](https://github.com/701-T4/flatshare/wiki/Github-Checklist---How-to-'Issues') when working on this project.

### Code Reviews

Please ensure you spend a good amount of effort on PR reviews. It is much easier to catch bugs here rather than having to open a new issue later.

Some things that are good to check:

- Does the code work? Does it perform its intended function, the logic is correct etc.
- Is all the code easily understood?
- Does it have correct linting?
- Is there any redundant or duplicate code?
- Is the code as modular as possible?
- Can any global variables be replaced?
- Can any of the code be replaced with library functions?
- Can any logging or debugging code be removed?
- Does code follow defined architecture?
- Ensure PR passes CI server, re-running once or twice if it fails. Failure could be due to other issues, so determine whether the PR is responsible if failure occurs.
- Request changes to the code and/or additional unit tests if any issues are found.
- Are good names used for classes, enum, methods, and variables?
- Do tests exist and are they comprehensive? i.e. has at least your agreed on code coverage.
- Do unit tests actually test that the code is performing the intended functionality?
